## Basic Info
This program is a Shell script for Linux Ubuntu. Its purpose is to provide an easy-to-use and convenient tool for creating clean Spring Boot projects with basic dependencies and configuration out of the box (Maven, Git, Lombok etc.).

## Prerequisites
Obligatory:
1. `tree` package from https://snapcraft.io/tree (to install it run `sudo snap install tree`)
2. `git` package (to install it run `sudo apt install git`)

Facultative (one of them, all or none):
1. IntelliJ IDEA Community
2. IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate
3. Visual Studio Code

## Script's Algorithm
The script is executed according to the following algorithm:

1\. Show welcome message<br/>
2\. Verify initial conditions:<br/>
2.1. `tree` package is installed<br/>
2.2. `git` package is installed<br/>
2.3. exactly one or two arguments were provided (exact number of required arguments depends on configuration, by default two are required):<br/>
2.3.1. an absolute path where the project directory is to be created (if this argument is required by configuration)<br/>
2.3.2. a project name<br/>
2.4. the absolute path where the project directory is to be created (the path passed to the command or hardcoded during the configuration) is correct<br/>
2.5. the provided project name is correct (should consist only of lower case letters and numbers; the first character should be a letter)<br/>
2.6. the project directory hasn’t existed yet<br/>
3\. Create the project directory (name of the project directory is the project name)<br/>
4\. In the project directory create the file structure according to the following template:<br/>
```
/home/herman/colibriproject
├── Dockerfile
├── pom.xml
├── README.md
└── src
    ├── main
    │   ├── java
    │   │   └── eu
    │   │       └── ciechanowiec
    │   │           └── colibriproject
    │   │               ├── DefaultController.java
    │   │               └── Main.java
    │   └── resources
    │       ├── application.properties
    │       ├── static
    │       ├── templates
    │       └── tinylog.properties
    └── test
        └── java
            └── eu
                └── ciechanowiec
                    └── colibriproject
                        └── MainTest.java
```     
The above file structure implements the default file structure used by Spring Boot when initializing projects at https://start.spring.io/ (captured on May 2022)<br/>
5\. Add default content to project files
6\. Initialize git repository in the project directory<br/>
7\. Set up git committer<br/>
8\. Open the project directory in the new window with IntelliJ IDEA Community, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate or Visual Studio Code if installed (this option works if it was turned on during configuration, by default it is turned off)

## How to Use
1. Make sure that prerequisites listed above are installed
2. Put the script (file `.spring_mantra.sh`) to the home folder so that its path will be `~/.spring_mantra.sh`
3. At the end of the script (file `.spring_mantra.sh`), after the comment-banner `DRIVER CODE`, there are 3 blocks of code encapsulated inside the pair-comments `>> START OF A CONFIGURABLE BLOCK` and `<< END OF A CONFIGURABLE BLOCK`. Configure the code in those blocks according to the clues contained in those blocks
4. Give the script permission to be run (`chmod 755 ~/.spring_mantra.sh`)
5. Set up the following alias for the terminal (on Linux Ubuntu aliases are usually specified in the hidden file `~/.bashrc`):<br>
   `alias spring='~/.spring_mantra.sh'`<br>
6. Restart all instances of the terminal
7. Now the script can be run by invoking the `spring` command
